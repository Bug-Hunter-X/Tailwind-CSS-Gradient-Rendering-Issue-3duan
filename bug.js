```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  A potential issue is that the gradient might not render correctly across different browsers or if the `from` and `to` colors are not properly specified.
