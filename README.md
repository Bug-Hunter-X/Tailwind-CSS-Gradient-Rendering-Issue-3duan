# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential bug with Tailwind CSS gradients where the gradient may not render correctly in all browsers or with certain color combinations.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The solution is in `bugSolution.js`

## Bug Description
The gradient specified in the Tailwind CSS class may not render consistently across different browsers.  This might be due to issues with color specification or browser compatibility issues.

## Solution
Ensure that the `from` and `to` colors are correctly specified and use browser-specific fallbacks if necessary to ensure consistent rendering across all supported browsers.  More robust gradient handling is shown in `bugSolution.js`
